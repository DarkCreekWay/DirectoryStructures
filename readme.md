# DarkCreekway's Tool for directory structures

---

Copying directory structures without copying the files contained in them to a
different location is not supported by Microsoft Windows Explorer.

This makes it cumbersome to apply proven directory structures to new places.

**DarkCreekWay's Tool for directory structures** adds the ability to capture and 
apply directory structures as context menu items to the Microsoft Windows Explorer.
