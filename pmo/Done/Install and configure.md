# User Story - Install and configure

As a user, i would expect an easy way to install and configure the new tool.
Running the tool with command line parameters is the opposite from easy.

The user unpacks the tool to a directory of choice.
He runs the config tool with a double-click.
The app asks some questions, and configures the app afterwards.

## Result

The user is enabled to use the tool with some simple clicks.

## Breakdown

* [x] Create new installation and configuration tool
* [x] Move required code to the new tool OR into a shared assembly
