# User Story - Install and configure

As a user, i would expect an easy way to install and configure the new tool.
Running the tool with command line parameters is the opposite from easy.

The user unpacks the tool to a directory of choice.
He runs the config tool with a double-click.
The app asks some questions, and configures the app afterwards.

## Result
